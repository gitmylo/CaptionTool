use OS.execute (or whatever the C# name is) to run ffmpeg

Example command to split a video (cuts from 1 minute to 2 minutes):
ffmpeg -ss 00:01:00 -to 00:02:00 -i input.mp4 -c copy output.mp4

You might want to create a formatter to support these numbers, also, being able to do it in milliseconds could also be helpful
This method does not re-encode, making it fast, but slightly inprecise.

According to https://superuser.com/a/377407, time can use format "00:01:23.000" or even "83" for just seconds (assuming decimals work here too)
